## details

#### icons

The commonly required icons are at `public/assets/`. Be sure to use the same filenames as they are referred to in the metadata at `public/index.html`. Tip: Use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) which automatically creates all the required icon sizes, and simply unzip the generated asset bundle into `public/assets`.

#### index.html metadata

The icons are all utilized in the `<meta></meta>` tags for Facebook, Twitter and Google indexing among others. Be sure to customize your app title and descriptions in all the tags.

#### service worker

Includes and registers a workbox-based service worker at public/

#### manifest

Customize `public/manifest.json` with your PWA's info for installation. Note that the manifest requires a 512x512 icon which is not generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). You have to manually create that one on your own using something like [https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png](https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png).
