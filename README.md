Svelte PWA starter
=============

Stripped down version of cerivitos/svelte-pwa-now

## Getting started

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed. Clone the repo and

```bash
npm install
```

Start by

```bash
npm run dev
```

and go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Build for production using

```bash
npm run build
```

and serve the `dist` folder.

## Details

### Rollup copy assets plugin

By default, Rollup does not copy static folders to `dist` when building. If you have folders with static assets like data files or images, put the folder path in `rollup.config.js` like so.

```bash
...
import copy from "rollup-plugin-copy-assets";

const production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH;
export default {
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...
    copy({
      assets: ["src/assets", "src/MORE-STATIC-FOLDERS"]
    }),
    ...
  ]
  ...
};
```

### PWA boilerplate

#### Icons

The commonly required icons are at `src/assets`. Be sure to use the same filenames as they are referred to in the metadata at `dist/index.html`. Tip: Use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) which automatically creates all the required icon sizes, and simply unzip the generated asset bundle into `src/assets`.

#### index.html metadata

The icons are all utilized in the `<meta></meta>` tags for Facebook, Twitter and Google indexing among others. Be sure to customize your app title and descriptions in all the tags.

#### Service worker

NOT WORKING PROPERLY

This template includes a basic service worker at `dist/service-worker.js` which simply checks against the currently held cache and loads from network if required. Feel free to further customize it for your needs.

#### Manifest

Customize `dist/manifest.json` with your PWA's info for installation. Note that the manifest requires a 512x512 icon which is not generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). You have to manually create that one on your own using something like [https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png](https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png).
