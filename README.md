Svelte PWA starter
=============

Stripped down version of cerivitos/svelte-pwa-now

## Getting started

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed. Clone the repo and

```bash
npm install
```

Start by

```bash
npm run dev
```

and go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Build for production using

```bash
npm run build
```

and serve the `public` folder.

## Details

#### Icons

The commonly required icons are at `public/assets/`. Be sure to use the same filenames as they are referred to in the metadata at `public/index.html`. Tip: Use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) which automatically creates all the required icon sizes, and simply unzip the generated asset bundle into `public/assets`.

#### index.html metadata

The icons are all utilized in the `<meta></meta>` tags for Facebook, Twitter and Google indexing among others. Be sure to customize your app title and descriptions in all the tags.

#### Service worker

NOT WORKING PROPERLY

This template includes a basic service worker at `public/service-worker.js` which simply checks against the currently held cache and loads from network if required. Feel free to further customize it for your needs.

#### Manifest

Customize `public/manifest.json` with your PWA's info for installation. Note that the manifest requires a 512x512 icon which is not generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). You have to manually create that one on your own using something like [https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png](https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png).
